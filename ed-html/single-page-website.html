                                    <li>In a small saucepan, combine sugar with 946 ml (4 cups) of water. Place over low heat and simmer until the sugar is melted. Allow to cool and refrigerate until well chilled, about 4 hours.</li>
                                    <li>Preheat oven to 162° C/325° F. Place the olive oil in a small saucepan over low heat; it will be used after the baklava is assembled and should be hot. Place two pastry sheets on the bottom of the casserole. Lightly sprinkle walnuts and a little cinnamon all over. Top with one sheet of pastry and again sprinkle with walnuts and cinnamon. Repeat until all the sheets are used, saving two unblemished sheets for placing on top.</li>
                                    <li>Cut the baklava into diamond shapes, and immediately brush all the cut edges with hot oil. Bake until pastry is lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and immediately (and carefully) pour the cold sugar syrup over it. The entire baklava, including the top, should be saturated. (If necessary, adjust the position of the top diamonds.)</li>
                                    <li>Cover lightly with waxed paper, and allow to soak for 1-2 hours. Drain and discard the sugar syrup. Cover and store at room temperature</li>
